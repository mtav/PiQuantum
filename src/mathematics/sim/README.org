#+TITLE: Quantum Circuit Simulator

* Notes
1) Malloc is able to allocate 28 double precision qubits but not 29. This makes sense because my computer has 8GiB of RAM, and 29 qubits of double precision requires 8 GiB (2^29 * 8 * 2 / 2^30 = 8; 8 bytes per double, 2 complex doubles per amplitude, 2^29 amplitudes). It's interesting watching htop broadly speaking confirm the memory requirements. Also, changing to single precision allows 29 qubits but not 30.
