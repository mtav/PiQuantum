 * @detail This file contains the global variable used by algorithms and
 * `simulator applications' to control the manipulation and display of the
 * state vector.
 * 
 * The variable has certain `input' variables:
 * 1) to specify single and controlled qubit operations to be performed
 * 2) to buffer several operations
 * 3) to specify the display mode (average or cycle)
 * 4) to request a display update
 * 5) to set the qubit `error level'
 * 6) to turn error correction mode on and off
 * 7) to perform a (projective) measurement on the qubits
 * 8) to reset the simulator
 * 
 * The variable has certain `output' variables
 * 1) to read the state of the external buttons
 * 2) to request the result of measurements
 * 3) to get the status of various operations
