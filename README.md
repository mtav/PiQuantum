## `Where quantum information processing meets best coding practice`

Our quantum computer currently has 4 qubits with corresponding Leds used to display their state and 4 quantum gates (operations available.

Operations you can do on the quantum computer
=====

This is a list of the exisitng operations available:
1. **NOT** gate (X)
2. **XOR** gate (CNOT)
3. **SWAP** gate (SWAP)
4. **AND** gate (Toff)

3. **HALF** gate (H)
4. **PHASE** gate (Z)




Qubit state display (Read out)
=====
We use RGB Leds to display the state of the qubits, there are two display modes currently 

## Displaying the average state


## Cycling through the superposition
